raspandmax
==========

Use with Raspberry pi or compatible SPI controllers and MAX1202, MAX1203 and MAX1204.
See schematic.png!

Compile with: cc -o raspandmax raspandmax.c
Run with root privileges sudo ./raspandmax

To enable the SPI interface you must modify the file
/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
commenting this line
#blacklist spi-bcm2708

Compile with: cc -o raspandmax raspandmax.c
Run with root privileges sudo ./raspandmax

If you want run the program without root privileges you can execute these command

sudo groupadd spi
sudo usermod -a -G spi pi
sudo su 
echo '"KERNELS=="spi0", SUBSYSTEMS=="spi_master", GROUP="spi"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-spi.rules
exit

that add the spi group and add to it the pi user.
The last line add a udev rule that assign the spi group to the SPI bus.
In that manner you can run the program
./raspandmax
without sudo
